				<h4 class = "discovered">CONCEPT</h4>
				<p>Dis • covered is an app that aims to help with the refugee crisis by making the transition into Canadian culture an enjoyable, social experience. This app brings public city events into one consolidated and easy-to-read mobile application so that users can check in to see what classes, events, and activities are being put on by city services like libraries, recreation centers, parks, and more.</p>

				<p>Other than necessities such as finding jobs and learning the language (which the government offers free aid for), many face unhappiness from isolation and little variation in their new life because of the unfamiliarities.</p>
				<p>Other than family, they have little to no contact with anyone else. During our research we found their world would gravitate only around the house and the few stores or services they could access in the neighborhood and often fall victim to loneliness and isolation.</p>

					​<p>As soon as they log in, users can see their current location and locations of upcoming events nearby.</p>
					<p>If an event is of interest, a quick info block appears for more details, as well as the travel distance. This way, the user can assess of attending this event is a viable option.</p>
					<p>The app encourages close walking distances. However, if cars and public transit are more appealing, any selected location can easily be opened up in Google maps for more travel options.</p>

					​<p>If they’re not sure that the event is right for them, the quick info block can be pulled up for more details. There will be photos and in depth descriptions of the event such as pricing, activities and possible equipment needed. All events are also tagged accordingly so they can be searched.</p>
					<p>When a decision is made, the user can indicate they are interested and follow the event. This way they can be updated on the latest news and be reminded when it comes to the time of the event.</p>

					​<p>What’s the best way to better understand what will happen? Hearing from others!</p>
					<p>Not only are users able to meet new people at local events, they can start the process online through the conversations on each event page. They can share their excitement, ask questions, and meet others who will be attending to prepare and learn all the ins and outs to have the best time.</p>
